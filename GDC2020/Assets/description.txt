You take on the role of a 1960's jazz musician, as you attempt to escape New Yorks finest before they wack you over the head.
Defend yourself with well timed trumpet blows, and survive as long as you can. 
In Dootout, it's doot or be dooted, and every note counts as the tenacious tenorman takes up arms against institutionalized police brutality.
